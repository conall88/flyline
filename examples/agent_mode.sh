# This file is compiled into flyline to help with auto setup.

# I recommend using trigger prefixes.
# When you type `: how do I find files older than 3 days?`,
# flyline sees that the buffer starts with the trigger prefix `: ` and sends `how do I find files older than 3 days?` (without the prefix)
# to the agent command configured for that trigger prefix.

# Claude has a --system-prompt flag so we could use that instead of making flyline prepend its system prompt, but for consistency with other agents we'll just prepend the system prompt in flyline.
